<h2>Hi! I'm Candi!</h2>
<p>I am a proud Trinidadian with a passion for life, love and graphic design. I’m a small business owner, writing her own story, learning from mistakes and celebrating everything else! <br /> 
  I believe that life is about the journey and not the destination and I plan to enjoy the ride creating beautiful designs, meeting beautiful people and forming lasting memories along the way. </p>

<p>I am a brand identity graphic designer doing what I love, growing in graceful alignment with the best version of myself. <br />
  I am intrinsically motivated and when my light is dimmed by life’s lessons, I am recharged by God, friends, family, nature (and Adobe CC). </p>
  
<p>I believe that I am the creator of my universe and I live my life with gratitude, hope and love.
